#This problem is for the Nov 2, 2011 Meetup#

Write a program that reads the portfolio in portfolio.dat, the stock prices in
prices.dat, and prints out how much the portfolio has increased or decreased.

Extra Credit: Portfolio.dat and prices.dat both have a small number of stocks.
At the meetup, a second set of files will have a much larger number of stocks
to analyze. We'll use the comparison between both sizes to talk about writing
code that is reusable and that scales to handle a larger number of inputs.
